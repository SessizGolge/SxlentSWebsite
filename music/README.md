# Music Files

Add your music files to this folder. Supported formats:
- `.mp3` (MP3 Audio)
- `.m4a` (MPEG-4 Audio)
- `.wav` (WAV Audio)
- `.ogg` (Ogg Vorbis)

## How it works:

1. Upload your music files to this `/music/` folder
2. The music player will automatically detect and load all supported audio files
3. Files will be listed in the player in the order they appear

## Example:
```
/music/
├── Song 1.mp3
├── Song 2.mp3
├── Song 3.m4a
└── Song 4.wav
```

The player will:
- Play/Pause your music
- Next/Previous track navigation
- Shuffle mode for random playback
- Loop modes (no loop, loop all, loop one)
- Volume control
- Progress tracking with seek functionality
- Persist across all pages on your site

Enjoy your music! 🎵
